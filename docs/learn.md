### How to learn a ML Algorithm?

**1.** Motivation

Each algorithm have its own motivation. It may a simple example to see how it work

**2.** Problem Definition

Where can we apply this algorithm? How did it work in real world applications

**3.** Mathematics Representation

Problem Equations, notations

We will discuss about mathematics representation of algorithm, notations we use for problem

**4.** Algorithm

We will discuss how to solve this mathematics problems

**5.** Examples

We will apply algorithm with a few examples (1-2 dimension is highly recommended, because we will plot these data and model easily)

In this section, we can see how well (bad) algorithm works with these data

**6.** Implementation Notice

We will give some notes about implement this algorithm to real world problems. What case we want to apply this algorithm? What case we don't?

**7.** Quiz

One way to rethink about problem is doing quiz.


**8.** Exercise

Now we give readers opportunity to work will this algorithm by themselves.
