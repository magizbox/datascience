# Machine Learning

> Machine learning is a branch of science that deals with programming the systems in such a way that they automatically learn and improve with experience. Here, learning means recognizing and understanding the input data and making wise decisions based on the supplied data.

We can think of machine learning as approach to automate tasks like predictions or modelling. For example, consider an email spam filter system, instead of having programmers manually looking at the emails and coming up with spam rules. We can use a machine learning algorithm and feed it input data (emails) and it will automatically discover rules that are powerful enough to distinguish spam emails.

Machine learning is used in many application nowadays like spam detection in emails or movie recommendation systems that tells you movies that you might like based on your viewing history. The nice and powerful thing about machine learning is: It learns when it gets more data and hence it gets more and more powerful the more data we give them.

# Conferences

<a href="http://icml.cc/" target="_blank">ICML - Internal Conference on Machine Learning</a>

The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the leading international academic conference in machine learning, attracting annually about 500 participants from all over the world. It is supported by the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS). The conference attracts leading innovations in the field of machine learning.

<a href="https://nips.cc/" target="_blank">NIPS - Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing </a>

The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December. The conference is a single track meeting that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. According to Microsoft Academic Search, NIPS is the top conference on machine learning.

The Deep Learning and Representation Learning Workshop will be held in conjunction with Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)

Deep Learning algorithms attempt to discover good representations, at multiple levels of abstraction. There has been rapid progress in this area in recent years, both in terms of algorithms and in terms of applications, but many challenges remain. The workshop aims at bringing together researchers in that field and discussing these challenges, brainstorming about new solutions.

KDD provides the premier forum for advancement and adoption of the "science" of knowledge discovery and data mining. KDD encourages:

<ul>
    <li>Research in KDD (through annual research conferences, newsletter and other related activities)
Adoption of "standards" in the market in terms of terminology, evaluation, methodology
Interdisciplinary education among KDD researchers, practitioners, and users
KDD activities include the annual Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining and the SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter.</li>
</ul>

# Journals

<a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">JMLR - Journal of Machine Learning Research</a>

The Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) provides an international forum for the electronic and paper publication of high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of machine learning. All published papers are freely available online.

<a href="http://www.jair.org/" target="_blank">JAIR - Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</a>

JAIR(ISSN 1076 - 9757) covers all areas of artificial intelligence (AI), publishing refereed research articles, survey articles, and technical notes. Established in 1993 as one of the first electronic scientific journals, JAIR is indexed by INSPEC, Science Citation Index, and MathSciNet. JAIR reviews papers within approximately three months of submission and publishes accepted articles on the internet immediately upon receiving the final versions. JAIR articles are published for free distribution on the internet by the AI Access Foundation, and for purchase in bound volumes by AAAI Press.
